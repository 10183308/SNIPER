Soft Sampling re-weights the gradients of RoIs as a function of overlap with positive instances for training robust object detectors with missing labels. This ensures that the uncertain background regions are given a smaller weight compared to hard-negatives.

[Soft Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06986) is described in the following paper:

### Installation
Please refer to the master branch for installation instructions.
<a name="demo"> </a>

### Training
SNIPER makes it possible to train on the OpenImages dataset in 3 days. For training the model with default configs you can use the following script:
```
python main_chips_open.py
```

The model we trained on OpenImagesV4 used Soft-Sampling which is implemented in [multi_proposal_target_layer.cu](https://github.com/mahyarnajibi/SNIPER-mxnet/blob/SNIPER-mxnet-open/src/operator/multi_proposal_target.cu) in the [SNIPER-mxnet-open](https://github.com/mahyarnajibi/SNIPER-mxnet/tree/SNIPER-mxnet-open/) branch.

Please note that while the branch is able to reproduce the results, it is out of sync with the master branch and would be updated soon.
