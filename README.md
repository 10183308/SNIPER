R-FCN-3k is a real-time detector for up to 3,130 classes. The idea is to decouple object detection into objectness detection and fine-grained classification, which speeds up inference and training with only marginal mAP drop. It is trained on ImageNet Classification data with bounding boxes and obtains 34.9% mAP on ImageNet Detection Dataset (37.8% with SNIPER).

With generalized objectness detection, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a universal objectness detector. With the universal objectness detector of R-FCN-3k, we can obtain a detector on anything in seconds by learning only the classification layer.

[R-FCN-3k](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01802) is described in the following paper:

## Demo for Detection on New Classes

With the trained universal objectness detector, you can obtain a new detector simply by training a light linear classifier in seconds!

1. Please download trained R-FCN-3k model [[GoogleDrive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10QOmpklDcY2eO-Lfc3IjY0b9XcTEiYY8/view?usp=sharing)[[BaiduYun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JdxL6B1K3HD_8DjWcrAOwQ) and put them into
```
SNIPER/output/chips_resnet101_3k/res101_mx_3k/fall11_whole/
```

2. Download images [[GoogleDrive]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fYsCF6q-bctZMNrLPQkNHJEVxL5LpnYM)[[BaiduYun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/13HmwE8NdksogxTJb_gFwiw) for new classes and put it in `demo/`.

3. Run `python demo.py` to extract features and train the classifier on new classes. Visualization of detection results on evaluation images are saved in `vis_result`.

4. You can use your own data to train the classifier and obtain a detector. Simply put image folders under `demo/image/` (like demo/images/cat/xxx.jpg) and run `python demo.py`. You may need to change train eval split strategy and hyper-parameters based on your own data and purpose.

## Demo for R-FCN-3k

With trained R-FCN-3k detector, you can detect up to 3,000 classes.

1. Please follow previous instruction to get trained R-FCN-3k model.

2. Download the modified ILSVRC2014_devkit [[GoogleDrive]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hEG-GmMrvp--hWRU41RMBLB3gL-IdXs9)[[BaiduYun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1b4CygPofSTEGR03Ny6_3VQ) and put it in `data`.

3. Run `python demo_3k.py` to detect with R-FCN-3k. Source images should be put in `demo/image_3k/`. Visulization are saved in `vis_result`.
