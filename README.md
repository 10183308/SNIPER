# SNIPER: Efficient Multi-Scale Training

SNIPER is an efficient multi-scale training approach for instance-level recognition tasks like object detection and instance-level segmentataion. 
Instead of processing all pixels in an image pyramid, SNIPER selectively processes context regions around the ground-truth objects (a.k.a *chips*).
This significantly speeds up the multi-scale training as it operates on low-resolution chips. 
Moreover, SNIPER benefits from *Batch Normalization* during training as it makes larger batch-size possible for instance-level recognition tasks.

### Training a model
For training SNIPER on COCO, you would need to download the pre-trained models, the pre-computed proposals used for negative chip mining
(you can also use any other set of proposals), and configure the dataset as described below.

*Downloading pre-trained models*

Running the following script downloads and extract the pre-trained models into the default path (```data/pretrained_model```):
```
bash download_imgnet_models.sh
```

*Downloading pre-computed proposals for negative chip mining*

Running the following script downloads and extract the pre-computed proposals into the default path (```data/proposals```):
```
bash download_sniper_neg_props.sh
```

*Configuring the COCO dataset*

Please follow the [official COCO dataset website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) to download the dataset. After downloading
the dataset you should have the following directory structure:
 ```
data
   |--datasets
         |--coco
            |--annotations
            |--images
```

To train a model with SNIPER and default parameters you can call the following script:
```
python main_train.py
```
The default settings can be overwritten by passing a configuration file (see the ```configs``` folder for example configuration files).
The path to the configuration file can be passed as an argument to the above script with the ```--cfg``` flag .

### Evaluating a trained model
*Evaluating the provided SNIPER models*

The repository provides a set of pre-trained SNIPER models which can be downloaded by running the following script:
```
bash download_sniper_detector.sh
```
This script downloads the model weights and extracts them into ```data/sniper_models```. 
To evaluate these models on coco dataset with the default configuration you can run the following script:
```
python main_test.py --weight_path [PATH TO THE DOWNLOADED WEIGHTS]
```
The default settings can be overwritten by passing the path to a configuration file with the ```--cfg``` flag 
(See the ```configs``` folder for examples). 

*Evaluating a model trained with this repository*

For evaluating a model trained with this repository, you can run the following script with the same configuration file used during the training.
The test settings can be set by updating the ```TEST``` section of the configuration file (See the ```configs``` folder for examples).
```
python main_test.py --cfg [PATH TO THE CONFIG FILE USED FOR TRAINING]
```
This would produce ```json``` file containing the detections on the ```test-dev``` which can be zipped and uploaded to the COCO evaluation server.
